                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and
                  others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, animal
                  coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can spread
                  between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that causes
                  COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory

                  Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is
                  why CDC recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home
                  (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of
                  infecting others.</p>
                <p>How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone
                  from isolation is made on a case-by-case basis in consultation with doctors,
                  infection prevention and control experts, and public health officials and involves
                  considering specifics of each situation including disease severity, illness signs
                  and symptoms, and results of laboratory testing for that patient.</p>
                <p>Current <span>CDC guidance for when it is OK to release someone from isolation</span>
                  is made on a case by case basis and includes meeting all of the following
                  requirements:</p>
                <p>The patient is free from fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
                <p>The patient is no longer showing symptoms, including cough.</p>
                <p>The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens
                  collected at least 24 hours apart.</p>
                <p>Someone who has been released from isolation is not considered to pose a risk of

                <p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through

                  COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to
                  always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.

                  eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>
                <p>In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there
                  is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped

                <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO
                  website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries
                  around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks.
                  Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping
                  their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the
                  latest news.</p>
                <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some
                  simple precautions:</p>
                <ul class="style-ul">
                  <li>
                    <p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or
                      wash them with soap and water.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Why?</span> Washing your hands with soap and water or
                      using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who
                      is coughing or sneezing.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Why?</span> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray
                      small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If
                      you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19
                      virus if the person coughing has the disease.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Why?</span> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up
                      viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose
                      or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene.
                      This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when
                      you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Why?</span> Droplets spread virus. By following good
                      respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as
                      cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty
                      breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions
                      of your local health authority.</p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Why?</span> National and local authorities will have the
                      most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in
                      advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the
                      right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of
                      viruses and other infections.</p>

                  <li>

                      COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places –

                  of COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath)</p>

                      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare provider’s
                      office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from
                      getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state
                      health department for additional guidance. If the patient has a medical

                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some
                  patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or
                  diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become
                  infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about
                  80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of
                  every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty
                  breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood
                  pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.
                  People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
